THis is my intial test path which is basically array of 3 paths, test[0] being first path , and every path have 2 array each being x & y corrdinates, for example test[0][0] is x cordinate of path 1 & test[0][1] is y cordinate of path 1, similarily test[1][0] is x cordinate of path 2 & test[1][1] is y cordinate of path 2

for each path generate 3 new
